# Dress-to-Protect

**Background** <br /> 
Dress to Protect is a web application that encouragers teenagers to rewear their existing clothes instead of buying new ones -- saving the environment and their wallets! The application allows users to upload images of their own clothes which get analyzed using computer vision and matched to an existing 3D model that is customized accordingly. Then, users can dress up their avatar with all their pieces of clothing which shows them that they already possess all the clothing items they need and don't need to buy new ones! By logging these outfits, they collect points in the forms of leaves which are tracked by the app. Since this was created on a local server, they can also compete with their friends for the highest score. If you have not worn a piece of clothing in a long time, our mascot, Elle, will remind you and ask if you'd like to donate it by looking at the donation sites in the surrounding area. Additionally, there is a marketplace with listings of other people's clothing items and you can reach out to them to purchase their items! From outfit planning to tracking your carbon footprint and finding local donation centres, Dress to protect is your go-to for practising sustainability in style.
