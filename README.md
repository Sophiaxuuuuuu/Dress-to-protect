# Serve-to-Conserve

**Background** <br /> 
Did you know it takes over 766 gallons of water just to make a single T-shirt? And that cute outfit you bought last week? It might take longer to decompose than your entire lifespan. From excessive water waste to high energy consumption, fast fashion has a devastating impact on the environment. The fashion industry is a leading contributor to global carbon emissions, making it essential for consumers to become more mindful of their clothing choices.

Serve to Conserve aims to help users make eco-friendly fashion decisions, reduce waste, and live sustainably without sacrificing style.
